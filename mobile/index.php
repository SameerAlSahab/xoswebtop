<p>What can xOS Mobile do?</p>
<p>xOS Webtop can do basic things you would do in a normal Operating System. It edits rich text documents, views uploaded documents from xOS Webtop, browses the web, and so much more.
<p>With ever increasing web technologies we are given the opertunity to give you the best and most advanced webtop experence ever. With new HTML5 anything is possible. Lets break down what is possible.
<p><strong>Documents</strong>
<p>xOS Explorer makes it easy to upload, download, and view documents. No need to send an email to your self anymore. Trust me we email alot of files between each other and at ourselves. xOS Explorer's upload tool solved that problem.
<p><strong>Productivity and Inventivness</strong>
<p>We all use text editing. Now when you don't have it you have it. Text editing is part of all our lives. Now in xOS you can edit rich text documents and even html source code on you MOBILE device. Tell us that, that is not cool.
<p><strong>Ease of Use</strong>
<p> xOS Mobile, just like xOS Webtop, is so simple your grandma could do it. Yes you, your grandma, your baby, even your great-grandpa can do it. Let's just teach him how to use a mouse first. I suggest having him play Solitare. Everyone will be happier then, he gets to play solitare and you teach him to use a mouse without even lifting a finger.
<p><strong>Open and Free for All</strong>
<p>Who here hates to pay for extremely expensive software? Wow, isn't that alot of hands going up. With a small fee of $ 000,000,000.00, you can get all the great features of xOS. Yes absolutely free. No strings. No catch. Sign Up and find out. Yes we do relize that is a significant amount of zeros. I think it made our point. However, donations are gladly accepted.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't we all love our mobile devices. Most of us couldn't live without it. With xOS your phone will love you back and you will love your phone even more then before. xOS Mobile gives you a rich and unique UI and innovative features. They are literally on the cutting edge of technology. I believe we may be the most advanced mobile webtop OS out there. And without using flash. It appears that <a href="www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">Apple was right about HTML.</a>
