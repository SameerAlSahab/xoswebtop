xOS Webtop
=========

HTML/CSS/JS based "operating system" in the browser. 

This was the first project I worked on when I began programming about 4 and a half years ago. (December 2009) I no longer have the time to maintain this project and improve the security of the user accounts (Oh yeah, md5 passwords all the way). I am just putting the code here on GitHub to save it. You can take it. Upload it to your own server (please don't use md5).
